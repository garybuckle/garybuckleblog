## Running in the forests of Germany

I arrived in Weilerwist in September, a small town outside of Cologne. I had already committed to running the Colgne Marathon and whilst training for that event I discovered the [Erft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erft). I like running alongside the banks of rivers or canals but it's flat, very flat. That said the flatness of the Erft got me ready for the flatness of Cologne so I am not complaining. Running along the Erft though did not feed my soul the same way running in the forest does. [Linslade Woods](http://linsladewood.info/) or [Rushmere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockgrove_Country_Park) being great examples.
So here I am discovering [Villewald](https://www.villewaelder.de/en/) on my own! It was a slow process and I logged my routes on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/), in fact thanks to Kommoot I managed to find my way through the paths that are not shown on normal maps like google maps or apple maps. So actually I can highly recommend Komoot. More to come.....
