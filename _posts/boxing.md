# Basic Boxing for Fitness.

## Phase 1 training session.

This is a cardio workout with a strong emphasis on the core. Phase 1 sessions offer a low impact on joints and legs but increase speed, power and strength. The trainer may need some time during the session to demonstrate the correct technique. The goal is to improve fitness while learning the basics of boxing. Learning to box can be considered a skill acquisition and the happiness gained by learning something new.
The aim will be to focus on the technique but allow the student to move along slowly. Perfecting the technique will take time and it will be a lot of fun along the way.
Circuits are a high quality, high octane workout. They should build strength and endurance and can compliment other training programs.

### Duration.

40 - 60 minutes.

The routine can be a weekly session and you can aim to move up to Phase 2 within a month but you may also find that Phase 1 is everything you want and remain here.

### Warm Up

5 minute head down to feet stretching.
Ensure that no over stretching takes place but that all of the muscles are allowed to stretch.

### Intro if required.

- Any injuries?
- Importance of the Stance, fists, distance, pad etiquette - only hit the pad when the pad is facing you, this way the trainer controls the session.
- Definition of basic punches. Jab, Cross, Uppercut, Left Hook, Ducking and Weaving, Slipping.
- All rounds are 3 minutes with a 30 second rest. Some rounds will be sub split into 3 X 1 minute, depending on the activity.
- The Slipping, Ducking and Weaving will strengthen legs and core, help you to build power when punching.
- Rotate and reseting the stance is very important and designed to encourage a proper stance and technique after throwing combinations. This will enhance your session and help prevent any injuries.
