# Things I have learned from injury.

Active people do not react well to doing nothing.
I am no exception but as I sat in the spring sunshine resting and believe me, there was lots of resting.
I began to contemplate how I could make the best out of the situation. The best out of not doing what I have loved doing for a long time.

Easy answers came first:

- The bits of me that had been complaining about the running and the squash like my left foot, with the [Plantar fasciitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis), a feature since the Berlin Marathon. After saturday morning pressure sessions with my [coach](https://www.darrenwithey.co.uk).
  I would hobble around avoiding puttting pressure on my left foot.

- My wife would see more of me.
- I would have time to read more!
- I wouldn't have to worry about getting up at 5am.

But there might be more to it than that.
Surely I could come of this stronger? better? even fitter?

As I sat outside listening to Rich Roll's Finding [Ultra](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39665673-finding-ultra-revised-and-updated-edition?ac=1&from_search=true) on an Audiobook
I began to wonder if and how I could actually improve from this horrible experience.

Firstly though, here is the disclaimer :

> There are people in the world a lot worse off than me!
> They don't sit around complaining and moaning like I did!

Very much inspired by [Black Box Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611735-black-box-thinking) I began to plot my comeback!

## Where am I?

I made a very honest and direct assessment of my physical condition.
Calorie intake was as high as it had been whilst active. Cut down the calories!
I hadn't drunk alcohol for 4 months so that was already sorted. My beer drinking data had proven conclusively to me and possibly only applicable to me, that this was a major cause of weight gain.

### What could I do?

### What am I allowed to do?

Well that was an easy answer - I couldn't do anything do to possible damage to the retina or risk another harmorige.

I had to make sure the minute I could do ‘something’ I used the time appropriately and effectively. That meant plotting a course of recovery and not just banging out a 10km run or an intensive boxing session.

## Visualisation.

I started to visualise squash games, I started to visualise positions on court, movement, racket position and mental approaches. I mean what else could I do! I couldn't actually get on court myself. I spent literally hours thinking about it but not actually doing it.
What an anorak!!!
I spent a long time reviewing running styles and training sessions. Mentally going through the circuits I could do and when I could do them.

## The recovery

Eventually I was able to start doing light exercise.
By the way, do not rely on the doctors or surgeons defining that one for you. As an individual you will have different pain thresholds and different ideas about _'pushing it'_ or taking it easy. That could prove disastrous to your given medical condition
For me it had to be very _clear_.

I started walking my old running routes and the walks would give me that time to think through stuff, when you're too busy doing high end cardio you don't seem to have the time to think though the training.
I measured the walks using my Polar H7 and this was strictly zone 1 and zone 2 territory.
[Zones](https://support.polar.com/uk-en/support/tips/Polar_Sport_Zones)

[More about Zones](https://www.polar.com/blog/running-heart-rate-zones-basics/)

> HOW CAN I USE THIS TO IMPROVE MY RUNNING?
> Variety is good. Mix different workouts, vary the duration and intensity of your training sessions. Don’t get stuck running the same distance every time.

[Independent article on zones) (http://nataliejohanna.com/blog/2016/6/the-complete-guide-to-heart-rate-training)

So now you know a bit more about zones.

So I started in zone 1 and zone 2 and according to [Rich Roll](http://www.richroll.com/blog/lactate-testing-training-zones/) this is not a bad thing.

## Advanced recovery - getting back on the horse.

> "You may start upping your exercise, nothing extreme though. Nothing that will cause a lot of vibration or pounding, maybe cycling and oh..... don't worry about the heart rate. Push it a bit if you like"

Music to my ears!

So now I could start some 'serious' stuff at last but no pounding or vibration.

So running and skipping are out as was squash!

Cycling it is!

#### Stationary cycling aka Spinning.

I built up slowly taking time to sit in the lower zones without worrying about the performance. So back to the point of the blog.... I was training not to measure the performance but more for the actually act of doing it. Something I hadn't done in a long time. I was learning a lot from this and yes I was also feeling much better about myself. Sitting on the bike, much like walking also helped me think things through.

#### Slow motion ghosting.

Firstly what is [ghosting](http://www.lancashiresquashandracketball.co.uk/blog/2016/10/20/video-paul-carter-on-ghosting/). As explained by England coach - Paul Carter.

The great Nick Mathew:

> I have two different types of solo practice. One is where I want to do a bit of a physical workout where I’ll do a lot of what’s called ghosting, which is basically movements without the ball.

I had used 'ghosting; before because it reminds me of shadow boxing. The art of perfecting technique without the pressures of an opponent.

Sounds good but not many outside of top club players and pros use it. It's not sexy and as exciting as playing, it's hard work and therefore it doesn't happen.

When you have no choice though and you are desperate to hold a racket it's different story.

Deprived of choice I ghosted but very, very slowly!
No bouncing up and down or jerky movements. I watched videos of the pros and did my best, in my own head, in a narrow strip at the side of my house to emulate them.

- Moving very slowly into position and dragging the racket through the air.
- Pulling out of the shot and recovering smoothly.

The parallels between the biomechanics of squash and boxing are very close (doesn't make me a great player though).

In any case here is the real experience for me

> When fit and active I devote very little or no time to technique. I would rather be smashing a ball around the court, running at top speed, punishing the bag and sweating under high end aerobic routines.

Once deprived of the choice I was able to concentrate on improving my game.
Since starting playing again I have found that my style is a lot smoother. I feel more comfortable and able to recover properly.
Another step to playing proper squash.
All thanks to the injury.
