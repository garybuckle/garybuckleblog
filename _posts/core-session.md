20 minutes of skipping, headphones in and some Cumbia, African or Reggae flooding my brain.
Same routine since I was 14. 
I follow with  6 x 3 minute rounds on a punch bag, 30 seconds rest in between. 
​
Next I do 10 x 1 minute sprints or shuttles. Mostly with a racket in my hand to simulate a squash game.
​
This is mostly a venture out into zone 4 but I like the build up from zones 2 and 3 into zone 4.

​
I don't always record the next bits since they are not strictly cardio dependant.
I finish with sit ups and press ups and 3 x 1 minute wall sits ( legs at 90 degree angle, back against the wall)
​
​
Great session and not just for Sundays. In fact I will substitute this routine with a long run if I'm prepping for a marathon.
