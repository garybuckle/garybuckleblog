# recovering from a detached retina.

[what is a detached retina](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/detached-retina-retinal-detachment/).

For anyone active in sports activities this is quite a traumatic experience.

That was certainly the case for me, coming in a period where I was getting ready for a marathon, challenging in local squash leagues, about to embark on an ultra-marathon and generally enjoying a high level of fitness.

So how did it happen? - the question everyone asks!

I can think of no particular reason why this happened. No squash ball in the eye, no one punched me and I certainly had no trauma that I can recollect.

My first recollection of anything untoward was having floaters, actually in both eyes.
Floaters are small objects that seem to float in front of the eye, actually thay are inside it and often harmless!
I didn't expect any issues since my eyesight was perfect.

Then comes the crash!!! 


The diagnosis from my first hospital visit was a retinal tear, the treatment for which is laser and fairly standard.
Performed on the same day as my appointment, unfortunately it didn't work.

This meant I was sent to another hospital for a deeper, more intensive operation to fix the tear.

It was there that I was informed I had a detached retina.
Initially it's a bit of a shock since I'd no idea what that actually meant.
In any case the operation consists of laser treatment to 'weld' the retina back on to the wall of the eye.
In order to make the operation a success two things happen:
- A gas bubble is inserted into the liquid (vitreous) of the eye.
- for 5 days after the operation I had to posture. For 50 minutes of every 60 I had to lie with my head horizontal on the right hand side.


Not easy but I did it.

One complication I should mention, since if you've stayed awake so far  you might as well know.

After two days I was experiencing pain in my left eye along with headaches, nausea and sickness.
I returned to hospital where after measuring my ocular pressure was told that it was dangerously high.

So they operated again and removed some of the gas out of the bubble.

All was well.

I continued my recovery.

Almost two weeks post op, I was told by the surgeon that all looked good and I could resume light exercise.

The gas bubble would slowly dissipate and my world would return to pre op status.

So on Wednesday March the 28th with 6 weeks before my next marathon in Copenhagen I decided to resume light training.
I wasn't at all sure what that meant or what I wanted to do.
I knew I had to do something!

It was our wedding anniversary and my wife and I were going to have a meal together. I was feeling very good, I wanted to do something that made me feel even better.

So, drawing from 40 years of experience I did the thing that linked back to my youth.
Skipping!
20 minutes of jumping rope.
A classic warm up routine back in the day.

Donning my eye patch safety glasses to avoid the gas bubble from making me nauseous I started the routine.
Headphones on, Reggae and Cumbia washing over me.
Patterns and movements I'd honed over the years feeding my soul.

Yep it felt great!

After the session I made my way back into my house and felt the sweat coving my body.
I was back!

Removing the glasses I was greeted with a black screen on my left eye.

Like black sky!

No vision.

At all!

It turns out my eye had haemorrhaged.
The iris flooded with blood, I was blind in my left eye.

After calls and visits to the hospital it transpired that not only had the eye haemorrhaged but that the retina had also detached once more.

On Saturday the 7th of April I was operated on for a second time.
The result of which was more laser and the insertion of silicon oil in the eye.

Initially the prognosis was very grim.

- "This might not be the last time we need to operate"
- "We cannot guarantee that your retina will not detach again"
- "Your vision in the left eye may not return to anything like it was previously "
-  "You may discover that your running days are over"

Not inspiring stuff!!


I was actually not disheartened by the candid outlook dispensed by the surgeon.


Two weeks later though his diagnosis was:

"Actually, it's not bad!"

I was encouraged by the results.
Despite the blurry vision, a result of dilating eye drops and the Silicon Oil.
I could see through the portal of my left socket.

So from the 7th of April till the 28th I did nothing.

No walks, no runs, no squash just nothing.


20 days is not long but it was a lifetime to me

Add to that the prospect of face down posturing for 50 minutes of every hour for the first 7 days post op.

On the 28th of April I ventured out.
Advice from the surgeon had been to wait until the eye drops were finished and start walking. His advice was to do sports that did not involve rapid movement of the head or heavy vibration.

- Walking
- Cycling 

Perfect!

After 3 weeks I started walking and 5 weeks post op, on the 14th of May I started cycling.
On the 25th of May I did 5k on a concept 2 Ergo rowing machine.

I have a recipe, a game plan that, touch wood has so far appeared to work.

I will update the post as I progress but as always please consider that all medical conditions are personal and never do anything unless you've checked it out with the medical staff.

Update:

After an 8 week post op the surgeon has given me the all clear to do exercise.
The two main areas I want to return to being.

- Running
- Squash 

The next step for the recovery of my retina will be to remove the oil.
After this will be a similar period of rest and taking care as per the last op.

With that in mind I have decided to let them remove the oil in October/ November.

This gives me time to run my much loved KÃ¶ln marathon.

So I'm officially starting training for that event.
