## Why?

Well that's probably a very good question and one that you should ask yourself before starting anything that requires an investment and invest you will!

It's definitely not straightforward to learn and it might take a lot of time. Let's not kid ourselves into thinking that you can just open your laptop and start writing the next FaceBook or Twitter.
It's worth pointing out though that there are rewards and whilst you might find it demanding at first, you can write some pretty nifty stuff even after a short while.

You would be amazed at what you can create.

### What is there to gain?

1. You can create your own web pages and make them look and behave exactly how you want.
2. You can even host your own local web server and serve out your pages from there.
3. You will understand more about what is happening when you are browsing other people's websites
4. When you learn to code you learn a lot about structure and process
5. You might get a career out of it
6. It's fun!...it actually is!

## Where do I start?

> At the beginning, always start at the beginning.

There are many blogs, articles and posts that will help you in your journey to become a programmer. I am just highlighting my experiences, I will list them out later in the article but if I missed one or two out and you discover a few interesting ones then [let me know](mailto:"buckle,g@mac.com")

No Drama!

## Start with one of these

[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)

These are absolute beginners websites, you don't need anything more than a web browser because they let you code from within the site itself.

They're great!

Covering most, if not all of the stuff that you will need to get you up to speed. There are lots of examples but you might wonder where do I start **exactly** and what does it all mean.
Start with html, then css and then javascript.
If you're stuck then take a look [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) MDN is a great reference.

They cater for everyone from beginner's to professionals.

### What is Web Development?

So here is my take on how to look at it:
A web page is like a word document, when you type, the words flow on to the document from left to right. As soon as they reach the end they pop out on to the next line. If you want to indent a word then you have to insert an indent. If you want to style a word then you have to select it and change it's size, colour, its type such as italic or bold. You do this by using the toolbar where all of the commands are located and nicely presented.

Essentially a web page is similar but the way in which the words, the content is displayed is a bit different. Everything that appears on your web browser is _rendered_ in a markup language called html - hypertext markup language. The text is _wrapped_ in tags like `<h1>` for example,

so this text
`<h1>A Header</h1>`
will be rendered like this

## A Header

on a web page.
It so much fun arranging the content using css to appear as you want it to on the web browser. It might look a bit tricky at first but once you learn a few of the basic rules then you're up and running.

Once you've gone through the two resources I have listed then you should be ready to start writing your own code.

## Coming soon...

## Setting up your own local development environment

This does depend on your Operating System which by know you probably know a lot more about anyway, curtesy of the tutorials you have already been thorough. While we are on that note, it ods worth pointing out that there is no de fact standard on what is the better development environment. If you're a happy Windows user, Mac user or Linux user you're going to be fine. I have in my time used all three.
If you are using Windows then you can start here:

  This is a phenomenal resource!
